# SokoBall

SokoBall is a mini-web game where you play as a ball trying to move crates to their designated spots. This is a twist of the Sokoban puzzle genre, where you normally move one tile at a time, similar to the 1982 Japanese game _Sokoban_. In this game however, you move until your ball hits a wall or crate. This limitation challenges the player to think critically on how to get to certain locations while rolling from wall to wall.

Audience
